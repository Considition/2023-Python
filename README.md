# Introduction

This is a start kit for those that will participate in Considition 2023 using Python.

main.py contains an example of:

- Fetching required data
- Submitting a solution to Considition 2023
- Scoring a solution locally and saving the "game"
  - There will be a request limit for the Considition apis so if you wish to train a AI/ML or trying some brute force solution you'll have to use the scoring function that comes in this repo.
  - Saved games can be visualized using the the notebook in this repo

visualization.ipynb is a notebook for visualizing games.

scoring.py contains the logic for how we score a solution.

api.py contains methods for using the Considition apis.

# Getting Started

We recommended using visual studio code (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with the "Jupyter" extension for running the note book in this repo.

----Running main.py-----

1. Install python 3.11. https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Navigate to the root folder of the project and create a virtual environment with required dependencies:

```console
   python -m venv .venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment and run

```console
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a .env file with you api token (see .example.env).

4. Run the program with

```console
   python .\main.py
```

----Running visualization.ipynb in vs code----

1. Complete above steps
2. Install the jupyter extension in vs code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter&ssr=false#review-details
3. Select the .venv created above steps as kernel for the notebook
4. Run the notebook
   - enter a game id
   - Choose to fetch game from the Considtion APP or locally from the "my_games" folder.
